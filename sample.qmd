## Installation

- Download [`drawing-tools.html`](https://github.com/mahmudstat/reveal-draw/blob/main/drawing-tools.html)
- Put it in the same directory as your `qmd` slide.
- Use the following in `yml`


```{.yml code-line-numbers="true"}

```

## Usage

- Add you contents to `qmd` file and render.

- Click on the draw icon ðŸŽ¨ to activate the drawing tools. Click the icon again to hide the tools.

## Demo

You can see a matured [demo here](https://docs.statmania.info/slide/02-random-variable.html). You can also downlaod and run the [`qmd`](https://github.com/mahmudstat/reveal-draw/blob/main/sample.qmd) file on this repository.

## Customization

You can easily change the icon style and behavior by editing the `drawing-tools.html` file.

## Advanced Usage

If you have many slides residing in the same folder, you can add the tool in your `_output.yml` and it would apply to all the slides in the directory. I have implemented [this idea here](https://github.com/mahmudstat/stat-lectures/tree/main/slide).

## Have Fun Drawing!
